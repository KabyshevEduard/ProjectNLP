# ProjectNLP
This is my NLP project. I wanted to classificate description of girls forms from my preference. 1 - its interesting for me, 0 - no. 
I have mined data from VK and telegram bot "Леонардо Дай Винчик". Natashas pretrained Navec embeddings was used by me. NN was made with PyTorch.
This project has bad results, because dataset is small. I collect it manually. But it gives me expirience and knowledge. So, my goal was achieved.
