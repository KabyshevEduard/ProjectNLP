# ProjectNLP
This is my NLP project. I wanted to classificate description of girls forms from my preference. 1 - its interesting for me, 0 - no. 
I mined data from VK and telegram bot "Леонардо Дай Винчик".In this project I applyed pretrained Navec embeddings. NN was made with PyTorch.
The metrics are bad. In my opinion, because of small dataset. But I have studited to preprocess text and to build NN arceticture with PyTorch. Thats why it wasnt useless.
