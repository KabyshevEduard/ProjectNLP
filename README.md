# ProjectNLP
This is my NLP project. I wanted to classificate description of girls forms from my preference. 1 - its interesting for me, 0 - no. 
I mined data from VK and telegram bot "Леонардо Дай Винчик".In this project I tried to apply pretrained Navec embeddings, create myself embeddings, tf-idf method and different NN. NN was made with PyTorch.
The metrics have bad results. In my opinion, its because of small dataset and preponderance one of classes. But I have studited preprocessing of text and building NN arceticture with PyTorch. At least it had some pluses. I've tried to concate encoders from different archetictures with linear layers. I've used encoder from transformer and seq2seq.
